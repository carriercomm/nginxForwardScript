nginxForwardScript
==================

Automatic generation of reverse-proxy configurations for complex clusters of web-servers.

Usage:
* for complete automation copy everything to /etc/nginx (if you don't want to do this, you can also symlink manually from another dir)
* look at the example configuration in loadbalancing/anExample
* hopefully the comments in the example are self-explaining. if not, feel free to tell me.
